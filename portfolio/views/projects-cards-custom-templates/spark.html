You can good bye to silos in the workplace as you expand beyong the confines of your normal social interactions. Spark works by connecting a given community of people randomly on a fixed interval of time. Spark Collaboration starts with group organizers who, after registering, can configure Spark Communities with settings such as the time interval between matches or group segments (Accounting, IT, etc.).</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting of features, and I encourage you to contact the users of the platform, is the network map, which visualizes the growth of a Communit throughout time in a fun, intuitive, and interactive way.</p>
